Climate change is already disrupting global agriculture. Rising temperatures, altered rainfall patterns, and extreme weather events—such as droughts in sub-Saharan Africa and heatwaves in South Asia—have led to frequent crop failures. Soil degradation is another major issue: higher heat speeds up moisture loss, causing erosion in places like the U.S. Midwest and forcing farmers in Central America to rely more on chemical fertilizers. Pests and diseases are also spreading into new regions; for instance, the fall armyworm is now attacking crops in southern Europe, and wheat rust appears earlier at higher elevations. These changes drive up production costs and threaten food security worldwide. Economically, reduced yields push up global food prices and harm exporting countries like Brazil and India. While organizations fund emergency relief and climate-smart farming projects, long-term adaptation and aggressive emission cuts are needed to protect millions of people from future shortages.
